Details of the Scrum ceremonies.

### Time-boxing
  - Time-boxing is setting a fixed time limit to any activity and letting other characteristics such as scope vary.
  - Scrum relies heavily on the principle of time-boxing. All meetings, ceremonies and project time windows are time-boxed. The sanctity of the time-box MUST be respected. This is a non- negotiable attribute of Scrum.
  - Time-box can be any length of time [1 year, 1 month, 1 day, 1 hour]
  - Control is achieved at the lowest level of time-boxing
  - If you are running behind the schedule, postpone it to the next time-box
  - Fixes the length of the iteration and the team determines how much functionality can be delivered in that fixed length of time
  - Advantages
    + Focus
      * Helps one to focus his attention on the job at hand for the specified period of time
    + Increased productivity
      * Defining a fixed time period and working diligently in a focused manner on the identified task, helps one to work smarter and harder and get more done. It helps to get away with "Parkinson's Law" and "Student Syndrome"
    + Realization of time spent
      * Defining a fixed time period helps you identify how much work is done in the specific time and avoids the idling time
    + Time available
      * Helps one to be consciously aware of the time available to perform the task at hand

### Release
The concept of a “Release” has been removed from the latest Scrum Guide. The idea being that each Sprint should be considered a mini-release.

  - The customer would like to know what they can expect over a period of time
  - The process of release planning helps the Product Owner to convey the plan giving logical milestones
  - However, there is no particular sanctity with the release plan – the team must be in a position to release as and when the customer(s) demand it

### Sprints
  - Sprint is a time-box within which the team needs to complete an agreed upon set of deliverables 
  - The goal of each Sprint should be to produce "working software" having "near releasable" quality
  - The duration of a Sprint is typically 1-4 weeks 
  - Once agreed, the Sprint deadline can NOT be extended
  - Sprint duration can change over a period of time or during the duration of the project

### Factors in selecting a Sprint duration
  - The length of the release being worked on
  - The amount of uncertainty
  - The ease of getting feedback
  - How long priorities can remain unchanged
  - Willingness to go without feedback
  - The overhead of iterating
  - A feeling of urgency is maintained

### No changes in a Sprint
  - Once the Sprint plan is agreed upon, there can be no more additions to the Sprint backlog
  - Changes to the committed stories are not allowed
  - There can be no extension to the Sprint deadline
  - The Product owner can:
    + Make changes to the product backlog (add, remove or change stories that are not in the Sprint)
    + Terminate a Sprint and re-plan (under extreme circumstances)

### Daily Scrum
  - Each participant answers 3 questions:
    1. What did you do yesterday?
    2. What will you do today?
    3. What’s in your way?
  - These are not status sessions for the manager
  - They are team member commitments in front of the team
  - They are important because
    + G: It Gets the team together 
    + I: Information is shared
    + F: It helps them Focus
    + T: It builds the Team
  - Best practices:
    + 15 minutes or less
    + The whole team stands (so that the meeting ends soon!) 
    + Even remote participants are required and they stand too! 
    + No side conversation until the end of the meeting

### Sprint Review
  - Attended by: Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and optionally other stakeholders
  - The team provides a demo of the working system with new features
  - Feedback from participants is taken and recorded
    + Product Owner should consider it as potential backlog items
  - Purpose of a Sprint Review:
    + Validate understanding of requirements
    + Get feedback
    + Check that the team is on track (or find out if it is not)
  - Also check
    + Items which were on the Sprint backlog but not completed (partially or totally) are added to the Product backlog
    + Product owner triages feedback and adds those to the backlog
    + If a customer (or stakeholder) wants to start using the product (or a feature in the product), the Product Owner takes a call about releasing it (alpha or beta)
    + Optionally record the demo and make it available to others who could not attend
    + The team formally closes the Sprint after doing the retrospective

### Sprint Retrospectives
  - A 1-2 hour meeting at the end of each Sprint
    + To review what is working and what is not
    + To come up with actions to improve
  - Attended by the Team, Scrum Master and optionally a neutral facilitator
  - What it is NOT
    + A meeting to assign blame
    + A performance review for senior management
  - Why are retrospectives important?
    + Provides the team visibility
    + Enables them to take control of actions
  - Making retrospectives effective
    + Create lists
      * What is working (Keep these)
      * What is not working
      * What could we try in the next Sprint
    + Get input from everybody
    + Prioritize the list and agree upon few things to try
    + Assign actions and follow up
    + Agree on token penalty of actions are incomplete
    + Find a way to make the meeting fun
