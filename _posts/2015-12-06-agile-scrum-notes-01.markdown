I am working on an Agile Scrum certificate. Reading notes are as follows.

# Traditional Development
  * Analysis
  * Design
  * Coding
  * Testing
  * Deploy
  * logically sound but assumes predictability, diffcult to react to unforeseen changes*

# Agile Manifesto
  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  * Responding to change over following a plan

# Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
  1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software
  2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage
  3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
  4. Business people and developers must work together daily during the project
  5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
  6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face- to-face conversation
  7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
  8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
  9. Continuous attention to tech. excellence and good design enhances agility
  10. Simplicity (the art of maximizing the amount of work not done)is essential
  11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
  12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly

# APM (Agile Project Management) Framework
  * **Envision**
    Determine the product vision and project scope, the project community, and how the team will work together
  * **Speculate**
    Develop a feature-based release, milestone, and iteration plan to deliver on the vision
  * **Explore**
    Deliver tested features in a short timeframe, constantly seeking to reduce the risk and uncertainty of the project
  * **Adapt**
    Review the delivered results, the current situation, and the team's performance, and adapt as necessary
  * **Close**
    Conclude the project, pass along key learning's, and celebrate

# Scrum
 * a methodology for software development that adheres to Agile principles of *iterative* and *incremental* development
