## Crystal

- **lightweight approach**

- Learn (Shu), Collect (Ha), Invent/Blend (Ri) techniques

- Seven principle
  - Frequent Delivery
  - Reflective Improvement
  - Close(Osmotic) Communication
  - Personal Safety
  - Focus
  - Easy access to expert users
  - Technical environment

## Extreme Programming (XP)

- **lightweight approach**

- A system of practices that a community of software developers is evolving to address the problem of quickly delivering quality software, and then evolving it to meet business problems

- Take proven practices to the extreme

  - If testing is good, let everybody test all the time
  - If code reviews are good, review all the time
  - If design is good, re-factor all the time
  - If integration is good, integrate all the time
  - If simplicity is good, do the simplest thing that could possibly work
  - If short iterations are good, make them as short as possible

- Values

  - Communication
    - Among the team
    - Between the team and customer
  - Simplicity
    - Avoid over-engineering
    - Focus on unlocking the value fast
  - Feedback
    - Helps the team steer in the right direction
    - Re-assures the customer about what the team is building
  - Courage
    - To follow the right practices, standards
    - Arises out of the confidence that basic hygiene is in place

- Practices

  - The Planning Game
  - Small releases
  - Metaphor
  - Simple design
  - Testing
  - Refactoring
  - Pair programming
  - Collective code ownership
  - Continuous integration
  - 40 hour week
  - Onsite customer
  - Coding standards
  - Open workspace
  - Daily schema migration

- Benefits

  - Team
    - gets clear requirements
    - makes technical decisions and follows best practices
    - not over-worked
  - Customer
    - gets business value fast
    - gets accurate feedback
    - can make business decisions and implement changes faster

## DSDM (revised version, Atern)

- **heavy approach**

- Basic concept

  - User involvement ensures the right business solution
  - Requirements evolve, but timescale is fixed
  - Early delivery enables early pay-back
  - Implement the 80/20 rule
  - Nothing is built perfectly first time

- Principles

  - Focus on the business need
  - Delivery on time
  - Collaborate
  - Never compromise on quality
  - Build incrementally from firm foundations
  - Develop iteratively
  - Communicate continuously and clearly
  - Demonstrate control

- Five core techniques

  - Iterative development
  - Time-boxing
  - MoSCoW prioritization
    - Must
    - Should
    - Could
    - Would
  - Facilitated workshops
  - Modeling

## Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

- **heavy approach**

- Core Values

  - A system for building systems is essential
  - Simple is better
  - Process steps should be obviously valuable to team members
  - Good processes move to the background

- Six Roles

  - Project Manager
  - Chief Architect
  - Development Manager
  - Chief Programmers
  - Class Owners (aka Developers)
  - Domain experts

- Five Processes

  - _Per project_
    - Develop an overall model
    - Build a features list
    - Plan by feature
  - _Per feature_
    - Design by feature
    - Build by feature

- Best for team with 10-250 developers, handy pool of talented workers, focus on good object model

## Agile Unified Process

- **heavy approach**

- Based on the Rational Unified Process (RUP), a method of managing Object Oriented Software Development

  - Develop iteratively â€“ risk being the primary driver
  - Manage requirements
  - Employ component-based architecture
  - Model software visually
  - Continuously verify quality
  - Control changes

- Four Life-cycle phases

  - Inception
  - Elaboration
  - Construction
  - Transition

- Six Engineering disciplines

  - Business modeling
  - Requirements
  - Analysis and Design
  - Implementation
  - Test
  - Deployment

- Three Supporting disciplines
  - Environment management
  - Configuration and Change management
  - Project Management

## Scrum

- **lightweight approach**

- Lifecycle

  1. Inputs from stakeholders
  2. Product backlog
  3. Sprint planning meeting
  4. Sprint backlog
  5. 1-4 week sprint w. daily standup meeting
  6. Sprint review
  7. Sprint retrospective
