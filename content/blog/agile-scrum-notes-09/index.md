## Principles in monitoring Scrum Projects

- Ideally, the TEAM should monitor its own progress

  - The manager or Scrum Master should NOT micro- manage

- The Scrum Master should try to provide the team visibility so that they can make informed decisions

- Common tracking mechanisms in Scrum
  - Daily stand-up meetings
  - Reviews and retrospectives
  - Metrics
  - Charts
  - Information radiators

## Metrics

- A metric is a standard for measuring or evaluating something.

- A measure is a quantity, a proportion, or a qualitative comparison of some kind.

  - Quantity: "There are 25 open defect reports on the application as of today."
  - Proportion: "This week there are 10 percent fewer open defect reports than last week."
  - Qualitative comparison: "The new version of the software is easier to use than the old version."

- Types of metrics
  - Business
    - RTF (Running Tested Features)
    - Earned Business Value (EBV)
    - Net Present Value (NPV)
    - Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
    - Return on Investment (ROI)
  - Process
    - Impediments cleared per iteration
    - Impediments & User stories carried over the next iteration
    - User stories done per iteration
    - Defects carried over the next iteration
    - Team member loading
    - Velocity
    - Backlog size
  - Project Testing
    - Acceptance tests per story
    - Defects count per story
    - Escaped Defects per cycle
    - Tests time to run
    - Tests run per frequency
    - Time to fix tests
  - Do's and Don'ts
    - Measure only a few things that matter (just because it can be measured doesn’t mean it is important)
    - It should be easy to calculate (ideally an automated process)
      - If it is too cumbersome, either people won’t do it or it will be incorrect
    - It should be easy to explain and interpret
    - It should result in tangible action
      - Behavior that you want to encourage OR
      - Behavior that you want to discourage
    - Use metrics to guide action, not for witch-hunts
    - In Scrum, team metrics are preferred
    - Do NOT use metrics for performance appraisals
      - It will usually result in perverse incentive to manipulate the number

## Charts in Scrum

- Commonly used charts:

  - Burn-down, Burn-up charts
  - Cumulative Flow Diagrams
  - Progress Charts
  - Risk profile graphs
  - Others

- Charts are useful because:
  - It indicates trends (trends are more important than absolute numbers)
  - It is more "visual" (a picture is worth a thousand words)
  - Management loves charts!

## Escaped defects found

Escaped Defects Found counts number of new escaped defects found over period of time (day, week, month).

## Velocity chart

## Information radiators

"An information radiator displays information in a place where passers by can see it. With information radiators, the passers by don't need to ask any question; the information simply hits them as they pass."

- Invented by Alistair Cockburn
- Team members can view the current state of the project : schedules, tasks, progress, issues
- Scrum teams should use it to make progress (or lack of) visible

![Information radiators](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/informationradiators-150601115937-lva1-app6892/95/information-radiators-8-638.jpg?cb=1433160070)

Most popular Information radiators are:

- Task Boards
- Big Visible charts (Includes burn down charts)
- Continuous Integration build health Indicators (Including lava lamps and street lights)

Effective Information Radiators should be :

- **Simple**: Should be Brief and concise.

- **Stark**: Should display the progress and expose problems. Errors should not be masked, rather used to improve the work and performance

- **Current**: Information displayed should be current

- **Transient**: The problems and errors shouldn't be there on the chart for long; once the problem has been rectified, it should be taken off

- **Influential**: Influences the team members and management and empowers the whole team to take decisions

- **Highly** visible

- **Minimal** in number
