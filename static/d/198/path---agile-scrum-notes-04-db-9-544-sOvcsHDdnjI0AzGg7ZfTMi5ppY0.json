All meetings, ceremonies and project time windows are time-boxed. The sanctity of the time-box MUST be respected. This is a non- negotiable attribute of Scrum.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time-box can be any length of time [1 year, 1 month, 1 day, 1 hour]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Control is achieved at the lowest level of time-boxing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are running behind the schedule, postpone it to the next time-box</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixes the length of the iteration and the team determines how much functionality can be delivered in that fixed length of time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advantages</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus</li>\n<li>Helps one to focus his attention on the job at hand for the specified period of time</li>\n<li>Increased productivity</li>\n<li>Defining a fixed time period and working diligently in a focused manner on the identified task, helps one to work smarter and harder and get more done. It helps to get away with “Parkinson’s Law” and “Student Syndrome”</li>\n<li>Realization of time spent</li>\n<li>Defining a fixed time period helps you identify how much work is done in the specific time and avoids the idling time</li>\n<li>Time available</li>\n<li>Helps one to be consciously aware of the time available to perform the task at hand</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Release</h2>\n<p>The concept of a “Release” has been removed from the latest Scrum Guide. The idea being that each Sprint should be considered a mini-release.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The customer would like to know what they can expect over a period of time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The process of release planning helps the Product Owner to convey the plan giving logical milestones</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, there is no particular sanctity with the release plan – the team must be in a position to release as and when the customer(s) demand it</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sprints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sprint is a time-box within which the team needs to complete an agreed upon set of deliverables</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The goal of each Sprint should be to produce “working software” having “near releasable” quality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The duration of a Sprint is typically 1-4 weeks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Once agreed, the Sprint deadline can NOT be extended</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sprint duration can change over a period of time or during the duration of the project</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Factors in selecting a Sprint duration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The length of the release being worked on</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The amount of uncertainty</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ease of getting feedback</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How long priorities can remain unchanged</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Willingness to go without feedback</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The overhead of iterating</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A feeling of urgency is maintained</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>No changes in a Sprint</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Once the Sprint plan is agreed upon, there can be no more additions to the Sprint backlog</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changes to the committed stories are not allowed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There can be no extension to the Sprint deadline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Product owner can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make changes to the product backlog (add, remove or change stories that are not in the Sprint)</li>\n<li>Terminate a Sprint and re-plan (under extreme circumstances)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Daily Scrum</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Each participant answers 3 questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What did you do yesterday?</li>\n<li>What will you do today?</li>\n<li>What’s in your way?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These are not status sessions for the manager</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They are team member commitments in front of the team</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They are important because</p>\n<ul>\n<li>G: It Gets the team together</li>\n<li>I: Information is shared</li>\n<li>F: It helps them Focus</li>\n<li>T: It builds the Team</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Best practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>15 minutes or less</li>\n<li>The whole team stands (so that the meeting ends soon!)</li>\n<li>Even remote participants are required and they stand too!</li>\n<li>No side conversation until the end of the meeting</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sprint Review</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Attended by: Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and optionally other stakeholders</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The team provides a demo of the working system with new features</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feedback from participants is taken and recorded</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product Owner should consider it as potential backlog items</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Purpose of a Sprint Review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validate understanding of requirements</li>\n<li>Get feedback</li>\n<li>Check that the team is on track (or find out if it is not)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Also check</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Items which were on the Sprint backlog but not completed (partially or totally) are added to the Product backlog</li>\n<li>Product owner triages feedback and adds those to the backlog</li>\n<li>If a customer (or stakeholder) wants to start using the product (or a feature in the product), the Product Owner takes a call about releasing it (alpha or beta)</li>\n<li>Optionally record the demo and make it available to others who could not attend</li>\n<li>The team formally closes the Sprint after doing the retrospective</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sprint Retrospectives</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A 1-2 hour meeting at the end of each Sprint</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To review what is working and what is not</li>\n<li>To come up with actions to improve</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attended by the Team, Scrum Master and optionally a neutral facilitator</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What it is NOT</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A meeting to assign blame</li>\n<li>A performance review for senior management</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Why are retrospectives important?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides the team visibility</li>\n<li>Enables them to take control of actions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Making retrospectives effective</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create lists</li>\n<li>What is working (Keep these)</li>\n<li>What is not working</li>\n<li>What could we try in the next Sprint</li>\n<li>Get input from everybody</li>\n<li>Prioritize the list and agree upon few things to try</li>\n<li>Assign actions and follow up</li>\n<li>Agree on token penalty of actions are incomplete</li>\n<li>Find a way to make the meeting fun</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Agile Scrum Note 04: Ceremonies","date":"December 24, 2015","description":"Details of the Scrum
