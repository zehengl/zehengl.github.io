as a “Speculative” activity, i.e., you make a forecast that is reasonable, based on the available information</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The plan is elaborated and becomes more and more definitive over a period of time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Normally on Agile projects, you plan based on “time-boxes”, i.e., fix the time and resources available and determine the features that can be delivered</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The plan has to be flexible and planning is an on-going activity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Try not to pack too much into the plan - allow space to accommodate changes</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Iterations allow for mid-course corrections</h2>\n<p><img

alt=\"iterations_allow_for_mid_course_corrections\"></p>\n<h2>Multiple levels of planning</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://myagilemind.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/image18.png\" alt=\"planning_onion\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Iteration planning considers the tasks that are needed to transform a <strong>Feature Request</strong> into working, tested software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Iteration Planning occurs at the start of each iteration</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product Planning involves a product owner looking ahead than the immediate release and planning for the evolution of released system</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Portfolio planning involves the selection of the products that will best implement a vision established through an organization’s strategic planning</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Release planning</h2>\n<p>A Release Plan presents a roadmap of how the team intends to achieve the product vision within the project objectives and constraints identified up-front</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It helps the product owner and the whole team decide how much must be developed and how long that will take before they have a releasable product</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A release conveys expectations about what is likely to be developed and in what timeframe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A release plan serves as a guidepost toward which the project team can progress</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Steps to planning a release</h2>\n<p><img

owner collaboratively explore the product owner’s conditions of satisfaction that include scope, schedule, budget, and quality.</p>\n<h2>Release Planning</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://scalingsoftwareagility.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/revised-release-plan1.jpg\" alt=\"release_planning_meeting\"></p>\n<p>The purpose of Release Planning is to define the contents of a release or a specific shippable product increment.</p>\n<h2>Velocity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Velocity is a measure of a team’s rate of progress per Sprint</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It is calculated by summing the number of story points assigned to each user story that the team <strong>completed</strong> during the Sprint.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Sprint planning</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Goal of Sprint planning is for the team to make a “good commitment” about what they will deliver at the end of the Sprint</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A “good commitment” means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Everybody is clear about the goals</li>\n<li>Everybody agrees that it is “achievable”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It should be achievable without sacrificing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sustainable pace</li>\n<li>Quality (near releasable quality)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Sprint pre-planning meeting and preparations would help</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Velocity driven sprint planning</h2>\n<p><img

src=\"http://blog.vsharing.com/Uploads/UserDirs/1/140/55941/Commitment-driven%20iteration%20planning.gif\" alt=\"commitment_driven_sprint_planning\"></p>\n<p>In Commitment driven sprint planning, the team is asked to add stories to the sprint one-by-one until they can commit to completing no more.</p>\n<h2>Find out how much time is available</h2>\n<p>Allow time for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Hacking, reading blogs, 20% time?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lunch, tea breaks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Email</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meetings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixing P1 bugs from previous version</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Time committed to other teams</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Planning for each story</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Find out what “tasks” are needed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design / Design review</li>\n<li>Code</li>\n<li>Unit test</li>\n<li>System and regression test</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Bug fixing</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Assign tasks to resources and re-estimate the tasks</li>\n<li>Make sure the team member has time available</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Keep in mind before finalizing the plan</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Does everybody in the team have enough (not too little and not too much) work to do?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have you considered correct capacity (e.g. account for planned leaves)?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you have some buffer to accommodate unplanned absence or other contingencies?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have you kept time aside for Scrum rituals: Planning, Stand-ups, Review, Retrospective?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do you understand the dependencies and have they been tied up?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Agile Scrum Note 07: Planning","date":"January 23, 2016","description":"Information about Scrum
